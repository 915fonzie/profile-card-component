## My process

Began with setting up all of the files that I would need. That includes my styles folder and all of the SCSS and CSS files. Then I started working on the index.html file by adding all the necessary sections I think I'll need for this project and if I realize I'm missing something later on, I'll add it then. Afterwards, I start working on styling the component taking a top-down approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project there wasn't anything new that I learned but I did get a better practice working on the simple things.

### Continued development

Hopefully on later projects I'll start adding animations and psuedo elements.
